            This has been one of my favourite and least favourite projects at the same time. It started off as me trying to test our MLAgents in unity. In the end however it became something rather different.<br><br>    
            Below is the final build however Beyond that is the story of how I ended up with this build. I hope you enjoy :)

            <h2 class="ProjectSubTitle1">The Development Story</h2>

            <div class="ProjectText1">
                The main inspiration for starting this project was that I wanted to learn how to use MlAgents with Unity. I thought a reasonable first experience would be to try a relatively simple game like snake.
                The making of the game didn't go too badly I had some issues with food generating on the snakes tail but other than that the game itself was playable.
                Now comes the part of actually implementing the AI.
                <br><br>
                My Friend Izack has experience with MlAgents so he helped me implement it into my game and then it was a case of tweaking it and letting it train.
                There were a few bugs along the way mainly with food generation.
                I was struggling to get food not to spawn in the snake.
                Eventually I got this fixed, I believe it was something to do with the order in which the scripts ran.
                Back to the AI.
                <br><br>
                Using MLAgents meant that a lot of the AI stuff is done behind the scenes.
                The only real thing I had to do was give it inputs.
                I ended up giving it a raycast from the head which could detect walls,food and the tail.
                I also gave it the coordinate position for the head and food.
                All in all I felt this was a good mix of inputs.
