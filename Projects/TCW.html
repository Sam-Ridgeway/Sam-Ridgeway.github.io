            This was a game that I developed as my A Level Computer Science Project.
            I really enjoyed making it and it was a great introduction to Unity and Game Development in general.
            </div>

            <h2 class="ProjectSubTitle1">A bit about the development</h2>

            <div class="ProjectText1">
                As mentioned above this project was done for my A Level Computer Science course.
                This means that it's a little more structured than some of my other projects and also has a report to go with it.
                The main idea of it comes from my love for Paradox games such as Hearts of Iron IV and Crusader Kings 3.
                I figured there wasn't really a game set around the cold war and I thought it fit the genre quite well so I decided I would give it a go myself.
                So after doing a bit of design work I was ready to get started.<br><br>

                I had settled on the main idea of the game being that you control the USA at the start of the cold war 
                and have to try and beat the Soviet Union in one of multiple victory conditions.
                This could be either the Space Race, nuclear war as well as a few others.
                A lot of the time was the UI design and development as that is how the game is played.
                The rest of the time was spent working on the AI that the user plays against.
                I ended up with a relatively simple implementation where the AI takes a random amount of weighted actions each turn.
                The result turned out pretty good and is what I stuck with for the final version.<br><br>

                The next thing I had to work on was a save system. 
                This was quite tricky at first as I had no experience with how you save data in Unity.
                In the end I found some tutorials online and applied what I learnt from them to my project and it did the trick.
                I used JSON files in the end as there were plenty of tutorials to follow and they suited my needs.

                Lastly I wanted to implement the ability to mod the game, mainly change names of characters. 
                This involved essentially creating a namelist in a file that allowed the user to change the contents then interpreting it accordingly.<br><br>
                That's about it for this project, thanks for reading.
